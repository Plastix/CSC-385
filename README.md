# CSC 385 Final Project
We made explosions in Three.js.

# Installation
Just clone the repo.

# Running
* If you use Firefox Quantum (`58.x`), just double click `index.html`
* If you use Chrome you'll need to launch a webserver to host the page. This is because Chrome blocks images 
(e.g. textures) from being loaded when reading from `file://`. 
    1. Launch `index.html` from inside of WebStorm. It defaults to using a local webserver
    2. Launch a manual webserver: Navigate to root of project and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
